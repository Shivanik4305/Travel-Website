                    <h3>Best time to visit Pelling:</h3>
                    <p>Pelling is famous for its panoramic mountain views, and lush greenery which wraps the town, giving it a gorgeous look. The best time to visit this town is during the summers when the temperature remains pleasant. The ones who are keen to indulge in outdoor activities should consider visiting between March and May. But, if you want to cherish the cold climes, then winter months would fulfil your wishes. I would recommend visiting in November or in February. Pelling is not a stand-alone destination and if you visit in December- January, you may not be able to visit some of the other exciting destinations nearby due to extreme weather conditions.</p>
