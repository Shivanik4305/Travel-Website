                    <br /><p> The word Mumbai is derived from Mumbadevi, the patron goddess of the Koli fisherfolk, the oldest inhabitants of Mumbai. The name Mumbai, in its final form, dates back to the 18 th century. For Portuguese, the name Bombay is Good Bay (“Bom” “Bay” Good Bay). Mumbai is a cluster of seven islands. These islands of no great value were ceded to Portuguese in 1534 by the Sultan of Gujarat. The Portuguese in turn given these islands to Englands’s Chareless II as part of the wedding dowry of Catherine of Braganza when she married Englands’s Charles II in 1661. </p>
