                    <h1>Allepy</h1>
                    <p>Kerala, God’s own country, with its beauty and bounty never fails to astound visitors from all over the world. One such enchantress of the state is Alleppey. The beautiful lakes and lagoons make Alleppey no less than ‘The Venice of the East’, a title quite rightly ascribed to this place. On these backwaters, thousands of houseboats called the Kettuvalam cruise in tranquillity all day long, with visitors on board.</p>
                    <h3>Best time to visit Allepy:</h3>

The summers are generally hot here, but the preparations for the famous Annual Boat Race commences in June.</p>
